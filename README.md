# Pepper Ball Plant Leaf Disease Classification

Welcome to the **Pepper Ball Plant Leaf Disease Classification** repository! , this project leverages cutting-edge computer vision and machine learning technologies to enhance Pepper Ball Plant Leaf Disease Classification.

## üìÑ Introduction
This code sets up a FastAPI server that utilizes a pre-trained TensorFlow model to classify images uploaded via API into different classes of Pepper Ball Plant Leaf diseases.
The primary objectives is:
- Detect the Disease in Pepper Ball Plant Leaf.

The system integrates CNN Architecture to detect disease in leaf.

## üéØ Features

**Ping Endpoint**
- Responds with "Server is Ready" to indicate the server status.

**Predict Endpoint**
- Accepts an image file via POST request, processes it using a pre-trained TensorFlow model (my_model.keras), and returns the predicted class and confidence score of the image.

**Output**
- The model outputs predicted class and confidence of prediction.

## Server Access Using Postman Software

- API accessible via the local host server at `http://localhost:8000`.

- Install Postman:

- If you haven't already, download and install Postman from [here](https://www.postman.com/downloads/).
- Create a New Request:

- Open Postman and click on New to create a new HTTP request.
- Set the Request Type and URL:

- Select POST as the request type.
- Enter the API endpoint URL: http://localhost:8000/predict.

- Set Headers:
- Add a new header with key 'Content-Type' and value 'multipart/form-data'. 

- Set the Body:
- Click on the Body tab and Select the "form-data" option.
- Add a new key-value pair where the key is file (must match the parameter name file in your FastAPI endpoint) and the value is the image file you want to classify. You can either drag 
  and drop the image file or select it using the file picker.

- Send the Request:
- Click on Send to submit your request to the API.

- You should receive a response with the predicted class and confidence of prediction.

For more details on using Postman, refer to the [Postman Documentation](https://learning.postman.com/docs/introduction/overview/).

## üèÅ Conclusion

In this project, the FastAPI server, powered by TensorFlow, utilizes a deep learning model to achieve 98% accuracy in predicting whether uploaded images of pepper plants exhibit bacterial spots or are healthy. The server efficiently processes image uploads, applies the model for classification, and returns the predicted class along with confidence levels. This implementation demonstrates effective integration of machine learning in web applications, particularly for agricultural disease detection, ensuring reliable and timely identification of plant health issues.

Future work will focus on improving the models‚Äô accuracy, expanding the dataset, and exploring additional functionalities to enhance the system‚Äôs capabilities.
